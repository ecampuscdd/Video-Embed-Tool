Here is the eCampus Center Video Embed Tool

This program was set up originally by Chas and has been updated and edited throughout the years. Todd has copied the original work and created a new repository. 
The fork that was worked on will be deleted and a new link issued.

This Repository contains embed tools to help builders with their work. 
	YouTube Embed Tool The link everyone uses has a spot for the YouTube video. This link will be analized by the program. Using Google YouTube API v3, the program 
 looks for public information and pulls that info to be formatted into the proper syntax agreed upon in the Development Team meetings.
