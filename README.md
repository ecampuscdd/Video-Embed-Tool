# Video-Embed-Tool
Here is the eCampus Center Video Embed Tool

This Repository was create to centralize the tool and help builders with their work. The program looks for YouTube information and formats that info into the proper syntax agreed upon in the Development Team meetings.
This program was set up originally by Chas and has been updated and edited throughout the years. Todd has copied the original work and created a new repository. 
The original fork was archived and the new version has a new link. Forks and branches are now centrally controlled on the eCampus CDD account.

Recent changes to the structure now require Google OAuth 2.0 process which will require you to use your Google Credentials to aquire an access token for the YouTube API. That token is no longer available in the code (and the token in the archived version has been decomissioned). 

If you are not able to access the program, contact toddmiranda AT boisestate.edu with your name, email, and work you are doing to be granted access. Future itterations will hopefully remove this step but more to come.
